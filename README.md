Almost all of the code in this repo has been built on other platforms such as IBM Watson or IBM's Skills Network Lab.
I will appreciate contributions to this repo by adding material that can help me grow as a data scientist such as 
-practise material 
-topics that I should pay attention to
-examples of beginner level projects (with source code), etc.
